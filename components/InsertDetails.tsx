            Insert is a metallic part that is kept in the sleeper and is used to insert the clip that connects the Concrete sleeper with the Rail track. We manufacture Inserts in our foundry at Kallakal near Hyderabad. Insert production involves steps like preparation of molten metal, Mould formation in Dies by pouring molten metal, De-gating, Shot blasting, and final grinding to remove excessive metal formation. The factory has been established with state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities, and modern techniques like Robotics and the Internet of things (IOT) are being implemented.

            This unit has recently received approval from QA- RDSO( Drg. RT 381 Alt9) and started full-scale manufacturing. At Kallakal Foundry (KFCPPL) we will very soon also start manufacturing SGCI inserts for the wider base sleeper, which is the latest sleeper product that can enable increased speed of locomotive with high axle capacity. Base plates for Metro Rails are another critical component that we manufacture in this foundry.
